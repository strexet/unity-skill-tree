# Documentation Output Contract

This contract summarizes the deliverables owned by `REPO_INIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. The full source remains `references/REPO_INIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Required Root Files

- `README.md`: human entry point and setup summary.
- `AGENTS.md`: concise AI-agent handoff and mandatory reading.

## Required `Documents/` Files

- `PROJECT.md`
- `TECHNICAL.md`
- `FEATURES.md`
- `FUTURE.md`
- `RULES.md`
- `REPOSITORY_MAP.md`
- `BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`
- `TESTING.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `DOCUMENTS_SNAPSHOT.md`

## Optional Documents

Create optional specialized documents only when repository evidence justifies them:

- `UX_UI_MANIFEST.md`
- `PLATFORM_INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `BACKEND_AND_NETWORKING.md`
- `DATA_AND_PERSISTENCE.md`
- `ANALYTICS_AND_MONETIZATION.md`
- `LOCALIZATION.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `REFERENCES.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `GLOSSARY.md`

## Ownership Map

- `PROJECT.md`: product purpose, scope, users, non-goals.
- `TECHNICAL.md`: stack, architecture, data flow, constraints.
- `FEATURES.md`: implemented, partial, configured, disabled, or deprecated feature behavior only.
- `FUTURE.md`: Pending Queue, Prioritized Next Changes, Backlog.
- `RULES.md`: AI-agent workflow and repository editing rules.
- `REPOSITORY_MAP.md`: physical layout and ownership.
- `BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`: local builds, CI, signing, release flow.
- `TESTING.md`: test topology and validation matrix.
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`: packages, SDKs, sources, update constraints.
- `DOCUMENTS_SNAPSHOT.md`: explicit-request-only snapshot workflow.

## Live Filename Rules

Live documents use stable names without timestamps or snapshot markers. Snapshot copies belong only inside explicit snapshot archives.

## State Rules

- Implemented behavior belongs in current-state docs.
- Planned behavior belongs in `FUTURE.md`.
- Assumptions and open questions must be marked.
- Repository evidence outranks existing docs for current behavior.

## `FUTURE.md` Queues

`FUTURE.md` must contain:

```text
## Pending Queue
## Prioritized Next Changes
## Backlog
```

`Implement next` uses only `Prioritized Next Changes`. `Process pending` researches Pending Queue entries and promotes only implementation-ready tasks.

## Final Handoff

Report created and updated files, optional documents and why, major verified findings, drift found, open questions, checks run, checks not run, risks, and a suggested commit message.
