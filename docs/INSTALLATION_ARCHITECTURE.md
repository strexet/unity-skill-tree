# Installation Architecture

Last verified: 2026-06-10.

## Canonical Ownership

Canonical behavior lives under `skills/<skill-name>/`. Agent adapters describe installation behavior and optional bridges, but do not redefine skill content.

## Provider Matrix

`config/providers.json` is the single source of truth for:

- provider ids and labels;
- upstream `skills` CLI profile names;
- tier;
- detection probes;
- soft-provider status;
- project and global skill paths;
- optional bridge destinations;
- official references.

No shell, PowerShell, README, or test file may maintain a separate provider list.

## Installer Flow

1. Load provider matrix.
2. Parse selected providers from `--only`, `--all`, automatic detection, and explicit upstream `--agent`.
3. Exclude soft providers from automatic detection.
4. Resolve source: explicit `--source`, current repository root, or stop with a clear error.
5. Resolve selected skills.
6. Print planned paths.
7. In `--dry-run`, stop before writes or network commands.
8. Install by copy or symlink for local sources, or delegate to `npx skills add` for Git/unknown upstream profiles.
9. Write optional marker-fenced bridges only when `--with-init` is set.
10. Verify installed skill self-containment when requested.
11. Print a final result table and return non-zero on partial failure.

## Detection

Detection favors false negatives. Probe priority:

1. command on `PATH`;
2. IDE extension or plugin;
3. macOS application bundle;
4. reliable file;
5. directory-only soft probe.

Directory-only probes are soft and do not trigger default installation.

## Source Selection

Local source is preferred when running from a clone. A Git source is used only when explicitly configured with `--source`. The installer never invents a remote slug.

## Bridges

Bridge content comes from `src/init-rules/unity-repository-skills.md`. The installer inserts it between stable markers:

```text
<!-- BEGIN unity-repository-skills -->
...
<!-- END unity-repository-skills -->
```

Existing files are backed up before modification. Uninstall removes only the marked block.

## Uninstall Boundaries

Uninstall removes selected canonical skill directories or symlinks and optional bridge blocks. It does not delete shared instruction files or unrelated skills.

## Test Strategy

Tests use temporary directories and mocked provider detection. They cover local copy, symlink where supported, dry-run, bridge idempotency, soft-provider exclusion, upstream passthrough planning, provider matrix integrity, and self-containment.
